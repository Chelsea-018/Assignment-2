        <h2>Difference between Semantics HTML and normal HTML</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>A semantic element clearly describes its meaning to both the browser and the developer.It indicates the role of the content they contain, 
                examples are {header}, {main}, {footer} and so on.</li>
            <li>
                On the other hand, normal html element are used to structure content, not to define content's appearance, example {div}, {span}.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Disparity between closing tags and self-closing tags</h2>
        <p>A self-closing tag is a tag that does not need to be closed manually, it does not have a seperate closing tag, while closing tag has it's own seperate tag and is closed manually. </p>
        <h2>Inline and Block elements</h2>
        <p>Inline elements are element that allows other elements to be in the same line with them while block elements are elements that lets other element start another line that is beneath it.</p>
